# testoutputs
I have here two rather crude functions that output my statistical tests to more or less APA-style output. This started out especially with me wanting a simple function for frequentist t-tests but not I have moved more towards Bayesian t-tests. Importantly, both functions include an option to output the results including RMarkdown formatting so as to allow for easy intext implementation.
